# Rust Ray Tracer

A simple ray tracer written in Rust. Instructions taken from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#defocusblur) and translated from C++ to Rust.

## Getting Started

Run `cargo run > image.ppm` to create an output image called `image.ppm`.

`.ppm` files can be opened with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or viewed online [here](https://www.kylepaulsen.com/stuff/NetpbmViewer/) for example.

Here's one example result:

## Running the tests

Tests are run by the usual command `cargo test`.
